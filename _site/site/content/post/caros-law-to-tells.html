<p>One of the ten greatest books written on poker, this must-have book should be in every player’s library.  If you’re serious about winning, you’ll realize that most of the profit comes from being able to read your opponents.  Caro reveals the secrets of interpreting tells - physical reactions that reveal information about a player’s cards - such as shrugs, sighs, shaky hands, eye contact, and many more.  Learn when opponents are bluffing, when they aren’t and why - based solely on their mannerisms.</p>

<p>The book is broadly divided into two parts</p>

<h1 id="1-tells-from-those-who-are-unaware-that-they-are-giving-out-tells">1.) Tells from those who are unaware that they are giving out tells</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Players are either acting or they aren’t. If they are acting, then decide what they want you to do and disappoint them.</li>
  <li>Players often stack chips in a manner directly indicative of their style of play. Conservative means conservative; sloppy means sloppy.</li>
  <li>Players often buy chips in a manner directly indicative of their style of play
Flamboyant means flamboyant; guarded means guarded</li>
  <li>Any unsophisticated player who bets, then shares his hand while awaiting a call,
 is unlikely to be bluffing</li>
  <li>A trembling bet is a force to be feared : Player displays signs of shaking while making the bet,  it’s more likely to be a release of tension, not fear</li>
  <li>In the absence of indications to the contrary, call any bettor whose hand covers his mouth</li>
  <li>A genuine smile usually means a genuine hand; a forced smile is a bluff</li>
  <li>The friendlier a bettor is, the more apt he is to be bluffing</li>
  <li>A player glances secretly at his chips only when he’s considering
a bet — and almost always because he’s helped his hand
    <ul>
      <li>When the cards are dealt, don’t look at them; watch your opponent!</li>
      <li>When the flop lands in hold ‘em, don’t look at it; watch your opponent!</li>
      <li>When the next card arrives in stud, don’t look at it; watch your opponent!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a player looks and then checks instantly, it’s unlikely that he improved his hand.</li>
  <li>If a player looks and then bets instantly, it’s unlikely that he’s bluffing.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="2-tells-from-actors">2.) Tells from actors</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Disappoint any player who, by acting strong, is hoping you’ll pass</li>
  <li>Players stating at you are usually less of a threat than players staring away</li>
  <li>Players staring at their cards are usually weak</li>
  <li>Players reaching for their chips out of turn are usually weak</li>
  <li>A weak player who gathers a pot prematurely is usually bluffing</li>
  <li>When a player acts to spread his hand prematurely, it s usually because he’s bluffing</li>
  <li>If a player bets and then looks back at his hand as you reach for your chips,
he’s probably bluffing</li>
  <li>A forceful or exaggerated bet usually means weakness and a gentle bet implies strength</li>
  <li>When tells conflict, the player is acting. Determine what he’s trying to make you
do by his most blatant mannerism. Then generally do the opposite</li>
</ol>

<p>Another interesting stanza from this book is on choosing your seat. It is recommended to  sit behind (to the left) of opponents who play too many pots but who are unaggressive. That way when you raise, these players will already have money invested. If you’re on their right and raise, they probably won’t play and you’ll lose their action. Also, sit to the left of very aggressive, knowledgeable players. They can interfere with your strategy, so let them act first. Sit to the left of players who are loose,  that way, if you decide to raise, they’ll already be in the pot. To summarise when in doubt, sit to the left of the money.</p>
