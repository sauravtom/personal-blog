<h1 id="what-is-a-hand">What is a Hand?</h1>

<p>If you go to a poker tournament, you’ll notice that the top players are always sought out for their advice. A typical hand discussion between a beginner and a top player might go something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Beginner</strong>: Can I ask you a question about a hand?</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Sure, go ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Beginner</strong>: OK, thanks. So I’m holding king-queen suited, see, and there’s one call in front of me…</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: What position are you in?</p>

<p><strong>Beginner</strong>: Oh I don’t know - I guess maybe I was fifth to act …</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: What position was the first caller in?</p>

<p><strong>Beginner</strong>: I guess he was second … no wait, he was right under the gun … yeah, that’s right… no, maybe he was second… well, it was something like that.</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: How many chips did you have?</p>

<p><strong>Beginner</strong>: Gee, a lot, maybe $4,000, $5,000 - right in there.</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: And what were the blinds?</p>

<p><strong>Beginner</strong>: Oh, not that much, maybe $50/$100, $100/$200, something like that. But anyway, I called, see, and then this guy behind me raised! And everyone else folded around to me, and I didn’t know what to do…</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: How many chips did he have?</p>

<p><strong>Beginner</strong>: You mean the guy who raised me? I don’t know, who can remember all this stuff? Hey, I want to talk about the hand!</p>

<p>To the beginner, his hand was the cards he held, and what the players immediately before and after him did. To the pro, a “hand” was a lot more than that. It’s an entire situation, full of different elements, which has to be seen as a whole before good plays can be made.</p>

<h2 id="elements-of-a-hand">Elements of a Hand</h2>

<p>A hand in no-limit hold ’em has many facets, only one of which is the cards you hold. A good player considers all elements of the hand before making a play. Here are the basic elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What’s the status of the tournament?</li>
  <li>How many players are at your table?</li>
  <li>Who are the players at your table?</li>
  <li>How does your stack compare to the blinds and antes?</li>
  <li>How big are the other stacks at your table?</li>
  <li>Where do you sit in relation to the aggressive and passive players?</li>
  <li>What bets have been made in front of you?</li>
  <li>How many active players are left after you act?</li>
  <li>What are the pot odds?</li>
  <li>What is your position at the table after the flop?</li>
  <li>And last but not the least, What are your cards?</li>
</ul>

<p>In our next post we will dive deep into each of these categories.</p>
