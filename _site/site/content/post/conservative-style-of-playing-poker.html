<p>In conservative style poker you are</p>

<ol>
  <li>Playing fewer, but higher-quality hands than the average player.</li>
  <li>Playing the hands in a way that makes your subsequent decision-making easier and clearer.</li>
  <li>Avoiding all-in moves unless your hand is highly likely to prevail in a showdown.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="opening-requirements-in-conservative-play">Opening Requirements in Conservative Play</h2>

<p>These suggested opening hands apply to a full table of nine or ten players, where you are the first player to act.</p>

<p><strong>Early (first or second) Position</strong>: Raise with a high pair (aces, kings, or queens). Raise also with a medium pair like jacks or tens in an effort to reduce the field. Raise with ace-king (suited or unsuited) or ace-queen (suited).</p>

<p><strong>Middle (third through sixth) Position</strong>: Raise with all the above hands. Also raise with nines or eights, as well as ace-queen, ace-jack, or king-queen (suited or unsuited).</p>

<p><strong>Late (seventh or eighth) Position</strong>: Raise with all the above hands. Also raise with sevens, ace-x, or high suited connectors like queen-jack or jack-ten.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p>Remember there is a difference between opening a pot and entering a pot that has already been opened. If you decide to enter a pot that someone else has already opened, you want a better hand than you would require to open yourself from his position. If someone before you opens from middle position, you want one of your early position opening hands to make a raise.</p>

<p>When you play conservatively, a number of things will happen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll enter comparatively few pots. Good, solid hands don’t arrive all that often.</li>
  <li>When you do enter a pot, you’ll usually be the favorite in the hand. Players will have to draw out to catch you.</li>
  <li>You’ll have relatively easy decisions to make after the flop. If you start with good hands and the flop hits you at all, your hand will be very strong. When the flop misses you, you may still have the best hand, even if someone else has improved.</li>
  <li>You’ll win a lot of small pots, but not many big ones. Unless the players at your table are asleep at the switch, they’ll soon peg you as a “rock,” and adjust their play accordingly.</li>
</ol>
