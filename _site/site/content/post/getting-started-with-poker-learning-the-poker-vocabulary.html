<p><strong>All-in</strong>: A bet or raise of all the chips you have in front of you.</p>

<p><strong>Antes</strong>: Money placed in the pot by all players at the beginning of a hand. In a typical tournament, players don’t ante up until five or six betting rounds have passed.</p>

<p><strong>Big blind</strong>: A forced bet made by the player to the left of the small blind, to generate even more</p>

<p>action.</p>

<p><strong>Big stack</strong>: The player with the most chips at the table. If he uses his chips to push the other</p>

<p>players around, he may be known as the table captain or table bully.</p>

<p><strong>Blinded away</strong>: If the player with the short stack doesn’t play many pots, he may eventually lose all his chips when it comes his turn to play the blinds.</p>

<p><strong>Button</strong>: The player to the right of the small blind, who acts last on each betting round after theflop. The button is marked by a white disk which moves around the table counter-clockwise.</p>

<p><strong>Covered bet</strong>: Your all-in is covered if your opponent has more chips than you. In that case, you will be eliminated if you lose the hand, but he will not.</p>

<p><strong>Cut-off seat</strong>: The player to the right of the button.</p>

<p><strong>Domination</strong>: When two hands share a common hole card, the player with the lower other card is said to be dominated. When two players hold ace-king and ace-queen, the player with the queen is dominated.</p>

<p><strong>Flop</strong>: Three cards turned face up simultaneously in the center of the table. These cards are common to all hands. The flop is followed by a betting round</p>

<p><strong>Fifth street (also known as the “river”)</strong>: The fifth and last card turned up in the center of the table, also common to all hands. Fifth street is followed by a final betting round.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth street (also known as the “turn”)</strong>: The fourth card turned faced up in the center of the table, also common to all hands. Fourth street is followed by a betting round.</p>

<p><strong>Hole cards</strong>: The two down cards dealt to each player at the beginning of the hand. No other player can see these cards.</p>

<p><strong>Initial pot</strong>: The sum of the blinds and antes (if any) before the betting starts.</p>

<p><strong>Nuts</strong>: A player with the best possible hand has the nuts. Out: A card which will give you a winning hand if it arrives.</p>

<p><strong>Short stack</strong>: The player with the fewest chips at the table.</p>

<p><strong>Side pot</strong>: When several players go all-in, a side pot will include those chips than cannot be covered by the smallest stack. In a few cases, there may be multiple side pots.</p>

<p><strong>Small blind</strong>: A forced bet made by the player to the left of the dealer to initiate action.</p>

<p><strong>Stack</strong>: The pile of chips in front of each player.</p>

<p><strong>Stack ratio</strong>: The ratio of the number of chips in your stack divided by the initial pot. This number determines how aggressively you want to play.</p>

<p><strong>Sklansky’s Gap Concept</strong>: It takes a stronger hand to call than it does to raise.</p>
