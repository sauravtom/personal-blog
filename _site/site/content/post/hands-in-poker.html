<p>Managing the hands you choose to show or not to show is a crucial skill for players of different styles. The most general advice, which is always sound, is <strong>not to show your cards unless you have a very good reason</strong>. The more hands you show, the more information about your style you’re revealing to a shrewd and observant opponent. It’s a good rule, and one that I personally never violate.</p>

<p>But if you’re playing a different style, there may be some tactical advantage to occasional showing a hand voluntarily. I once watched one of the most successful super-aggressive players as he played in the early stage of a major no-limit hold ’em tournament. Although I couldn’t see his cards, I noticed that he was playing about one-third of the hands in the first couple of hours.</p>

<p>He was the only name player at his table, and the other players were according him plenty of respect. He was grabbing lots of small pots with well-timed raises either before or after the flop.</p>

<p>During the time I was watching, he never actually had to show a hand down. However, he would periodically turn over his cards when he bet and his opponent folded - an ace-king here, an ace queen there, a few pairs mixed in. What he was doing was controlling the table by showing the hands where he wasn’t bluffing, as if to say “Look, I’m playing a lot of pots, but see, I really am holding great cards.” Of course, he wasn’t showing most of his hands, where he was no doubt holding utter trash. But since people remember what they see, and not what they don’t see, he was leaving an impression of a player that could not be faced unless you were holding great cards.</p>

<p>Since the super-aggressive style is built around stealing pots, it’s very important for practitioners of this style to keep their bluffing frequency well-concealed. One tactic that works for this purpose is to make a bet on the end of a hand solely to avoid showing the hand down. It’s an unusual move, but when it works you win the pot and keep your opponents from seeing what you’re playing.</p>
