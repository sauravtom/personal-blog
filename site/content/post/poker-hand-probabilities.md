This also happens to be increasing order of probabilities of occurrence of each hand.

A standard playing card deck, also called a poker deck, contains 52 distinct cards.

These cards are divided into four suits: H,D,C,S or Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades.

Each hand is a combination of 5 of those cards. The number of possible poker hands are 2,598,960.

The best hand, i.e the royal flush is very rare with probability of occurrence at 0.000154% or once is every 649,740 hands. If you ever get to see one live, consider yourself very lucky.

## Hand Statistics

But as you may know there is so much more to poker than hands, one of those things is where you are seated. According to Pokerstars this is the online game play statistics for pots won while seated at certain positions.

The primary advantage held by a player in late position is that he will have more information with which to make better decisions than players in early position, who will have to act first, without the benefit of this extra information. This advantage has led to many players in heads-up play raising on the button with an extremely wide range of hands because of this positional advantage. Also, as earlier opponents fold, the probability of a hand being the best goes up as the number of opponents goes down.

The blinds are the least desirable position because a player is forced to contribute to the pot and they must act first on all betting rounds after the flop. Although the big blind has a big advantage on the first round of betting, it is on average the biggest money losing position.
