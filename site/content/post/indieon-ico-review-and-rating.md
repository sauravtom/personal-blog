**The indieOn ICO Music Token NDI Project**

The existing market size of the media distribution industry is valued at $13.8B. The current culture favors large production companies. This leaves a great majority of artists without a focused platform to promote their creative content. IndieOn ICO will change this culture with access to a decentralized platform and the technological advancements of Blockchain technology as well as a new approach to artistâ€™s benefits. IndieOn is passionate about Artists receiving higher value and faster service than they currently do from traditional streaming platforms.



The indieOn ICO project has created mobile and browser App based on a decentralized platform. A decentralized platform puts the protection of an artists identity and the rights for their produced goods in their hands rather than large corporations. It incorporates a highly intuitive user interface allowing Artists to upload their creative work item onto the indieOn platform. It is then published in a secure manner through a decentralized IP database (IPDB). This decentralized IPDB helps maintain the authenticity of every song/album, video or other creative content on a blockchain enabled digital platform. The indieOn ICO project is equally focused on defining an ecosystem of artists and small production houses that will benefit directly from a revenue recognition standpoint. Transactions on the indieOn platform are likely to use NDI tokens in exchange for Fiat or other cryptocurrencies that would be transacted through Secured Payment Gateways.



Upon successful payment, the buyer is given access to the specific creative content, media and artist merchandise.
