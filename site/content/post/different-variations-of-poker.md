## TEXAS HOLD'EM

The type played throughout the Poker World Series, Hold'em Poker sees players dealt 2 hole cards each. While 5 community cards are placed face up on the table. The winner is player with the strongest 5-card hand. Composed of 1 or 2 hold cards, and 3 or 4 community cards.



## OMAHA

In this variation, players receive 4 hole cards and have to make a hand with two hole cards and three community ones. Betting takes place in rounds, just as with Texas Hold'em. With the community cards being dealt three upfront, followed by one apiece for the next two rounds of betting.



## SEVEN-CARD STUD

Seven-Card Stud was at one time the most popular poker variation. Players are dealt 3 hole cards, two of which are face down. The player with the lowest value card (from those facing upwards) kicks off the betting. There are no community cards, and players are dealt 7 cards each in total (with rounds of betting in between). In the end, the player with the strongest 5-card hand wins.
