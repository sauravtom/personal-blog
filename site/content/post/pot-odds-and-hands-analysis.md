To figure out if a bet is a good one or not, you need to know the payoff when you win, and the odds against your winning. In poker, the payoff when you win is revealed by the pot odds. How much is in the pot, and how much does it cost you to play? The odds against your winning comes from an intelligent analysis of what's happened in the hand so far. 

## Calculating payoff odds

It is simply the ratio of what is in the pot and how much amount is required for you to make the call. They are of two kinds

* **Expressed Odds**: Odds calculated on 3rd or 4th street
* **Implied Odds**: Odds calculated on the river, these are the odds that matters.

## Calculating winning odds

If pot odds is mostly a science, hand analysis is mostly an art. Here you have to figure out what hands your opponent might be playing that would account for his bets so far, and then how likely each of those hands is, and then figure out how likely you are to beat each of those hands, given the hand you have. At the end of this process, you'll have a probability that you can win the hand. It will necessarily be a rough estimate, based in part on what you know about this opponent in this kind of situation. But it will give you a number to compare to the pot odds you already know, and in most cases, comparing those two numbers will yield a clear decision from a murky situation. 

Here are the most common, along with their probabilities and the odds of winning or losing when the hand is played to the end.

**1. Higher pair versus lower pair.** The higher pair is about 82 percent to win, or about a 4.5-to-l favorite. The most favorable situation for the higher pair is to be close in value to the lower pair. For instance, a pair of kings is a slightly bigger favorite against a pair of queens than against a pair of nines, because the kings interfere with some of the straights that would help the queens pull ahead. The presence of common suits also helps the higher pair slightly. In pair versus pair with two suits in common, the higher pair gains about 1.5 percent in comparison to pair versus pair with no suits in common.

**2. Pair versus two higher cards**. This is the basic "race" situation that you see so often in all-in showdowns in no-limit hold â€™em. The pair is about a 55-to-45 favorite. The pair does slightly better if it's close in value to the high cards, by eliminating some straight possibilities. The presence of common suits also helps the pair. (Obviously the unpaired hand is helped slightly if it is suited or connected.)

**3. Pair versus two lower cards.** Interestingly, if the two lower cards are close together in value this is only slightly more favorable than high pair versus low pair. The increased chance to make two pair and the increased chance to make a straight largely compensate for the loss of trip possibilities. The higher pair is about a 5-to-l favorite.

**4. Pair versus a higher and lower card**. The pair is about a 5-to-2 favorite. The chance of a straight drops since the pair is taking away two key cards, but there's about a 30 percent chance of just pairing the overcard which is mostly good enough to win.

**5. Two higher cards versus two lower cards**. The two higher cards are about a 5-to-3 favorite. This statistic always surprises beginners, who when they see ace-king against something like eight-six imagine that the ace-king must be a huge favorite. But whoever makes a pair mostly wins, and the edge for the ace-king just comes when no one makes a pair or both make a pair.
