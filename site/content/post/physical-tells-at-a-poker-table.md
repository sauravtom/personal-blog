Some games can be played without paying very much attention to who your opponent is or what he's trying to do. If you're a chess master, and you're playing an amateur, you don't need to care what he's thinking, planning, or scheming. The position on the chessboard contains all the information you need to crush him. You just make one technically good move after another, he makes his inevitable errors, and you finally wear him down.

Backgammon is a similar game, but one which offers a little more scope for exploiting known weaknesses. If you're a strong player playing someone weaker, you can just play your normal game and grind him down in the long run. But you can also improve your results and win a little more if you have observed mistakes in your opponent's game. You might, for instance, offer a double which would be technically incorrect against a strong player (because he would know to take it) but which works against a weak opponent because you've seen him pass doubles in such positions before. Spotting such an opportunity lets you win money with a play that would be a mistake against a stronger opponent.

Poker, however, is not like these other games. When you play poker, you aren't just trying to make "objectively good" plays. You are also trying to keep the nature of your plays concealed from your opponents, while simultaneously trying to figure out what they are doing, so you can counteract it. Balancing all these competing goals is a tough business, and doing it well requires you to have a keen appreciation of what's been going on at the table. I call this "reading the table," and it requires watching for physical tells, betting patterns, and your own persona. 

In the wonderful poker movie The Rounders, Teddy-KGB is undone when Matt Damon's character discovers his tell. If Teddy holds an Oreo cookie up to his ear, breaks it, and eats it, he has a monster hand. (He's psychologically devouring his opponent, you see.) If he merely listens to it break and puts it back in the tray, he's bluffing. As a result, the hero is able to break Teddy and survive with his bankroll and neck intact.

If only real life were that easy! Teddy's quirk is an example of a physical tell, a mannerism, expression, emotion or habit that in some way gives real information about your hand.

Cataloging tells is a whole book in itself, and fortunately it's already been done. Find a copy of Mike Caro's classic Book of Tells and read it thoroughly. It's a good treatment of a difficult subject.

Rather than try to duplicate the material in Caro's book, I'm instead going to pass on some of my insights into spotting and using tells.

Physical tells can be grouped into three categories:

1. Facial expressions
2. General body language
3. Hand motions 

Of the three, I've found that hand motions are the most reliable and revealing. Although most players are keenly aware of the need to control their facial expressions, they don't pay as much attention to what they do with their hands, particularly as they move chips into the pot. While other players are looking at faces, I like to watch hands. Basically, I'm looking to see if players handle their chips and move chips into the pot any differently with strong or weak hands. If I see something, I assign it a high degree of reliability until I get evidence to the contrary. In my experience, facial expressions and body language are more treacherous. I do watch for them, and you should too, but I need a bit more evidence before I'm willing to say I've spotted a true tell than with the hand motions.
