# What is a Hand?

If you go to a poker tournament, you'll notice that the top players are always sought out for their advice. A typical hand discussion between a beginner and a top player might go something like this:



**Beginner**: Can I ask you a question about a hand?

**Pro**: Sure, go ahead.

**Beginner**: OK, thanks. So I'm holding king-queen suited, see, and there's one call in front of me...

**Pro**: What position are you in?

**Beginner**: Oh I don't know - I guess maybe I was fifth to act ...

**Pro**: What position was the first caller in?

**Beginner**: I guess he was second ... no wait, he was right under the gun ... yeah, that's right... no, maybe he was second... well, it was something like that.

**Pro**: How many chips did you have?

**Beginner**: Gee, a lot, maybe $4,000, $5,000 - right in there.

**Pro**: And what were the blinds?

**Beginner**: Oh, not that much, maybe $50/$100, $100/$200, something like that. But anyway, I called, see, and then this guy behind me raised! And everyone else folded around to me, and I didn't know what to do...

**Pro**: How many chips did he have?

**Beginner**: You mean the guy who raised me? I don't know, who can remember all this stuff? Hey, I want to talk about the hand!

To the beginner, his hand was the cards he held, and what the players immediately before and after him did. To the pro, a "hand" was a lot more than that. It's an entire situation, full of different elements, which has to be seen as a whole before good plays can be made. 



## Elements of a Hand

A hand in no-limit hold â€™em has many facets, only one of which is the cards you hold. A good player considers all elements of the hand before making a play. Here are the basic elements:

* What's the status of the tournament?
* How many players are at your table?
* Who are the players at your table?
* How does your stack compare to the blinds and antes?
* How big are the other stacks at your table?
* Where do you sit in relation to the aggressive and passive players?
* What bets have been made in front of you?
* How many active players are left after you act?
* What are the pot odds?
* What is your position at the table after the flop?
* And last but not the least, What are your cards?

In our next post we will dive deep into each of these categories.
