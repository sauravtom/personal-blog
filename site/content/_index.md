    Do not play with anything more than you are comfortable losing. Poker is a
    high variance game - you can do everything correctly and still lose. It's
    always best to be prepared for the worst and have enough money to continue
    playing if things happen to go south.


    A good rule of thumb is to have at least 20 buy-ins to play cash games and
    at least 50 buy-ins to play tournaments. Tournaments are known to have a
    much higher variance than regular cash games, which is why you always want
    to have a higher amount of buy-ins to play.
